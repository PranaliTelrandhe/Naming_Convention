    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Step 2: Run Semgrep Naming Convention Scan
      # We use 'continue-on-error' so the build still runs even if rules are violated,
      # or you can remove it to block the build on failure.
      - name: Run Semgrep Scan
        run: semgrep --config semgrep-naming-rules.yml
        continue-on-error: true

      # Step 3: Format Code (CLang Format)
      # This fixes formatting for all .c and .h files in the directory
      - name: Run Clang Format
        run: clang-format -i *.c *.h

      # Step 4: Build C project
      - name: Build project
        run: gcc hello.c -o hello.exe

      # Step 5: Run the executable (acts as a basic test)
      - name: Run executable
        run: .\hello.exe
